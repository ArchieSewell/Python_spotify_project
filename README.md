# Overview
Welcome to my analysis on Spotify's Top songs in 2024. This project aims to provide some insight into the factors that affect the number of streams a song is getting on Spotify. Going into the project, I knew that I wanted to focus more on data visualisation, so I took an already fairly clean dataset and created some rather interesting and aesthetically pleasing plots that fit the Spotify theme. \
The overall purpose of this project is to be presented in my portfolio, so I tried to showcase a range visualisation skills using Python, and escpecially Pandas. \

# The Questions
For this project I had a number of questions, but the dataset I found only allowed for 2 of them to be answered. In the future, I will likely return to this project with a new dataset to answer the remaining questions, but for now I believe the project displays my visualisation skills well. 
1. What percentage of tracks are labelled as "Explicit"?
    - Does a song being explicit affect its streams?
2. How does the time of year that a song was release affect its spotify streams

# Tools & Technologies I used
- Python: All coding and analysis was done inside Python. I also used Python libraries including but not limited to:
    - Pandas: Used to analyse the data.
    - Matplotlib: Visualised some of the data.
    - Seaborn: Created the more advanced visuals.
- Jupyter notebooks: All code was completed inside of Jupyter notebooks, and all are available inside this repository (including comments to explain my work).
- Visual Studio Code: My personal favourite IDE.
- Git & GitHub: Used to share my work!

# The Analysis
Each Jupyter notebook tackles one full question, including any potential subquestions. Access to each notebook, including test code and comments, is available and linked with each question. Exploratory analysis following the generated plots is completed below.

## 1a. What percentage of tracks are labelled as "Explicit"?

Before answering this question, I undertook some necessary data cleaning, which included changing some data types. \
Once this was done, I summed the total count of songs, and plotting the number that was labelled as "Explicit" against those that were clean. \
Analysis for both parts of this question will be completed after the results. \

### Data Cleaning
```python
df['release_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Release Date']) 
df = df.drop('Release Date', axis=1)
df['explicit_track'] = df['Explicit Track'].astype('category')

def safe_to_int(value):
    try:
        return int(value.replace(',', ''))
    except AttributeError:
        return None

columns_to_convert = df[['Spotify Streams', 'YouTube Views', 'Spotify Playlist Count',
                         'YouTube Likes', 'TikTok Posts', 'TikTok Likes', 'TikTok Views',
                         'Soundcloud Streams']]
for col in columns_to_convert:
    df[col] = df[col].apply(safe_to_int)
```

### Visualise Data
```python
colors = [spotify_green, button_gray] # Easily change palette colour
explode = [0, 0.06] # Change the padding

# Set the theme to dark, to fit Spotify's colour scheme
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))
fig.patch.set_facecolor(background_color)
ax.set_facecolor(background_color)

# Plot the pie chart
wedges, texts, autotexts = ax.pie(explicit_counts, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, 
                                  colors=colors, wedgeprops=dict(edgecolor=background_color), explode=explode)

# Title, changing texts
plt.title('Percentage of Top Spotify Songs 2024 That Are Explicit', color='w', fontsize=(16))
for text in texts + autotexts:
    text.set_color('w')
    text.set_fontsize(14)

plt.show()
```

## 1b. Does a song being explicit affect its streams?
To answer this question, I generated a pair of kde plots. I then added vertical lines at the respective medians, and performed customisations to ensure the plot fits the Spotify theme.

### Visualise Data
```python
sns.kdeplot(df[df['Explicit Track'] == 0]['Spotify Streams'], color=spotify_green, label='Clean', fill=True, alpha=0.35, linewidth=2)
sns.kdeplot(df[df['Explicit Track'] == 1]['Spotify Streams'], color=button_gray, label='Explicit', fill=True,alpha=0.15, linewidth=2)
plt.xlim(0, 3e9)
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: '0' if x == 0 else f'{int(x / 1_000_000)}M'))

ax.axvline(df[df['Explicit Track'] == 0]['Spotify Streams'].median(), color='#1A9C55', linestyle='--', lw=2)
ax.axvline(df[df['Explicit Track'] == 1]['Spotify Streams'].median(), color='#808080', linestyle='--', lw=2)
```

### Results
![Spotify Explicit Songs Distribution](Images/spotify_dist_explicit.png)

### Insights

The percentage of top Spotify songs that are explicit stands at 35.9%, compared to 64.1% that are clean. This indicates that over one-third of the most popular tracks feature explicit content. The distribution of streams also reveals interesting patterns.

For explicit songs, the median number of streams is notably higher compared to clean songs, suggesting that explicit tracks generally attract more listens. The distribution plots show that both clean and explicit songs peak in frequency at lower stream counts (0-200 million streams), but as the stream count rises, the frequency drops, showing a right-skewed pattern typical for streaming data.

Clean songs, making up 64.1% of the top songs, follow a similar distribution pattern but with a slightly lower median stream count than explicit songs. This trend highlights a possible listener preference or industry focus that drives higher streams for explicit content.

Several factors might contribute to these differences. Audience preference for more authentic or relatable content could drive higher streams for explicit songs. Additionally, explicit songs may receive more aggressive marketing and playlist placements. The popularity of artists who produce explicit content can also skew the average streams higher for these tracks. Genre differences might also play a role, with certain genres that are more popular on streaming platforms tending to have more explicit content.

### Summary
Explicit songs, accounting for 35.9% of the top tracks, tend to have higher median streams than clean songs. Clean songs, though more prevalent, have a slightly lower median stream count. Various factors such as audience preference, marketing strategies, artist popularity, and genre differences could influence the higher stream counts for explicit songs. The overall distribution shows a typical right-skewed pattern for both categories, with a high frequency at lower stream counts and a long tail of songs with very high streams.

## 2. How does the time of year that a song was release affect its spotify streams?
I wanted to investigate how the time of year that a song is released affects its average streams, on a month-to-month basis. To avoid biased data, I first ensured that outliers were removed from the dataset. From there, I converted the date release to twelve columns of data, one for each month of the year, and found the median streams for songs of each month. From there, I decided to represent the data with a bar chart, as I believed this would best showcase the trend and possible relationship. \

### Visualise data
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
sns.barplot(x='release_month', y='Spotify Streams', data=monthly_avg, 
            hue='release_month', palette="blend:#1DB954,#B3B3B3", legend=False)

ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: '0' if y == 0 else f'{int(y / 1_000_000)}M'))

fig = plt.gcf()
fig.patch.set_facecolor(background_color)
ax.set_facecolor(background_color)
ax.tick_params(axis='both', colors='w')

ax.grid(color='gray', linewidth=0.3)
plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('Median Streams (Millions)', c='w')
plt.title('Average Spotify Streams per Track by Release Month', c='w')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results
![Release data streams](Images/python_streams_release_date.png)

### Insights


The distribution of average Spotify streams per track by release month reveals notable trends. The data indicates that songs released in January achieve the highest median streams, significantly surpassing those of other months.

Songs released in January reach a median stream count of over 400 million. Following January, the months of July and June also show high median stream counts, albeit lower than Januaryâ€™s peak. In contrast, February, March, April, May, September, October, November, and December exhibit relatively lower median streams, with March and May being among the lowest.

Possible Reasons for Differences in Average Streams:
January Effect: The high streams in January could be attributed to new year releases, where artists capitalize on the holiday season aftermath and new year resolutions, drawing significant attention and streams.
Summer Releases: The increased streams in June and July may be due to summer hits and festivals, where new music is often released to coincide with summer events and vacations, leading to higher engagement and streaming.
End-of-Year Releases: December shows a moderate level of streams, possibly benefiting from holiday season releases and year-end charts, but not as high as January due to the shorter duration within the year for accumulating streams.
Mid-Year Decline: The lower streams in February, March, April, and May might be due to fewer high-profile releases or less promotional activity during these months. These periods might not have as many strategic releases compared to the beginning and middle of the year.

### Summary
January leads with the highest median streams per track, likely due to strategic new year releases. June and July also show strong performance, aligning with summer events and festivals. The lower streams in February, March, April, and May suggest fewer high-impact releases or promotions during these months. The moderate streams in December could be driven by holiday season releases, though not as impactful as January due to limited streaming time within the year.

## Thank you
Thank you for checking out my project. My background is in Physics, so most coding is self taught outside of the Python and R modules I completed at university. If you have any feedback please let me know.
